On Tuesday morning, Theo Epstein resigned from his role as president of baseball operations with the Cubs after nine seasons, five playoff appearances and one historic World Series title. Epstein’s second five-year contract was going to be up after this season and he had given every inclination that he wouldn’t be back. But the move’s timing was a bit of a surprise.

화요일 오전(한국 시간 수요일)컵스에서의 9시즌과 5번의 플레이오프 그리고 한번의 월드시리즈 타이틀을 이뤄낸 테오 엡스타인은 컵스 사장직에서 사입을 했습니다. 테오는 2번의 5년 계약중 2번째 5년 계약의 1년이 남아있었습니다.

*Good Bye Theo*

새벽에 갑자기 엡스타인이 사임한다고 트윗이 올라왔습니다. 계약이 1년이 남아있었고 다음 목적지가 Mets나 Phillis나 Angels가 아닌 하는 생각이 들었는데, 모로시가 바로 트윗을 업데이트 해주네요. 거의 동시에 컵스 공식 트윗도 업데이트

[In a letter to the Cubs](https://theathletic.com/2203590/2020/11/17/theo-epstein-letter-to-cubs/), president Theo Epstein explains why he is stepping down. Before the news was official, he sent a note to his colleagues to explain himself. The Athletic obtained the note, which it is printing in full.

디 애슬레틱이 엡스타인이 컵스 동료들에게 보내는 편지를 얻었고 편지 내용입니다. 공식 발표가 있기전 그의 동료들에게 쓴 편지이고 그가 왜 사임하려고 했는지 이유가 담겨있습니다. 또한 편지에는 그가 컵스에 대한 감사와 존경을 담겨있고 그가 컵스와 함께 걸었고 만들어낸 많은 순간들과 현재와 미래 등등 여러가지 내용을 있습니다. 한 글자 한 글자 깔끔하고 그의 마음을 알 수 있네요.

### Greatest baseball executive of his time. Twice.

[Epstein a superstar in his field](https://www.mlb.com/cubs/news/theo-epstein-a-front-office-superstar) Mike Lupica(Mike Lupica is a columnist for MLB.com)가 쓴 칼럼의 부분입니다.
간단히 필요한것만 요약하겠습니다.
{:.faded}

Theo Epstein resigned as the Cubs' president of baseball operations on Tuesday. It means the most important baseball executive of his time -- this century in Major League Baseball -- is out of the sport, at least for now. And it means that for now he retires with the World Series trophies he brought to Boston and to the North Side of Chicago. All he did was end a combined 194 years of World Series waiting in those two places.

21세기 MLB 최고의 GM이며 그는 194년을 기다린 2개의 타이틀의 저주를 깼습니다.

In October 2011 he went with the Cubs. Five years later, the '16 Chicago Cubs had won their first World Series in 108 years. Theo had torn them down and built them back up, and built himself another champion, in another capital of his sport.

2011년 10월 컵스로 왔습니다. 5년 후 16년 컵스는 108년만에 타이틀을 획득했습니다. 그는 컵스에서 다 허물고 처음부터 다시 만들었습니다.
{:.faded}

If it is baseball to which he decides to return, whenever and wherever he decides to return, he would immediately become the biggest free agent in the world, because of what he did in Boston and Chicago. In his field, he is a superstar.

만약 그가 언제 어디서든 야구계로 돌아오기로 결심한다면, 그가 보스턴과 시카고에서 했던 것들 때문에 그는 세상에서 가장 대형 FA가 될 수 있을겁니다. 그의 영역에서 그는 슈퍼스타입니다.

After nine seasons, three division titles, a pennant and an historic World Series championship, Theo Epstein is saying goodbye to the Cubs. That surprising news came Tuesday afternoon, announced jointly by the team and its outgoing president of baseball operations. “I believe this is the right decision for me even if it’s a difficult one,” Epstein wrote in a statement released to the press. “And now is the right time.” Chicago will now be under the control of Jed Hoyer, the team’s general manager and Epstein’s long-time second in command, but the fate of both the franchise and its departing boss is less clear.

Taking over the Cubs in October 2011 after leaving the Red Sox under a cloud (and disguised as a gorilla), Epstein helped transform Chicago from National League also-ran and frequent cellar dweller into a juggernaut, culminating in the 2016 World Series win that ended a century-long title drought. He and his lieutenants drafted, developed or acquired virtually every important piece of that ‘16 roster, from Kris Bryant to Anthony Rizzo to Kyle Schwarber to Jon Lester to Jake Arrieta, and set the stage for what looked to be a dynasty. But diminishing returns and short postseason stays have left the Cubs in the championship cold over the last four seasons, and now their architect is moving on.
