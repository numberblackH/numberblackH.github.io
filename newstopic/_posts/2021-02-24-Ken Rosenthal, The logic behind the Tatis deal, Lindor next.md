[Rosenthal: Difficult decisions remain for Yankees and free agent Brett Gardner](https://theathletic.com/2386505/2021/02/13/rosenthal-difficult-decisions-remain-for-yankees-and-free-agent-brett-gardner/) &mdash; <The Athletic, Ken Rosenthal>

Fernando Tatis Jr. could have gone year to year, become a free agent entering his age 26 season and signed for more than $340 million. Extensions always come with a tradeoff: A player gains long-term security but sacrifices the potential for even greater riches.

By conservative estimates, Tatis might have earned $50 million in his three years of arbitration if he had stayed healthy. He then would have hit the open market in a post-pandemic world, with the baseball economy presumably more stable under a new collective-bargaining agreement. The Great Free-Agent Shortstop Class of 2021-22 further would have boosted his potential earning power, elevating the market at his position.

All that makes sense in theory. But seriously, how many of us would risk a guaranteed $340 million for the potential to earn perhaps $450 million?

Maybe Nationals right fielder Juan Soto will make such a choice, hit the market at 26 and become the game’s first $500 million player. But let’s not confuse Tatis’ decision to accept the third-largest guarantee in major-league history with, say, Ronald Acuña’s decision to sign an eight-year $100 million extension with the Braves after he won the National League Rookie of the Year award in 2018.

Acuña at the time had played in only 111 games, 32 fewer than Tatis. But many on the players’ side questioned his deal, and for good reason. Acuña agreed to two club options, extending the club’s control through his age 30 season, a point at which clubs are more reluctant to spend big on free agents. His annual salary over the course of the deal never will be higher than $17 million.

Tatis, on the other hand, will be paid $34 million over his next four years, then average $30.6 million over his 10 free-agent years, according to MLB Network’s Jon Heyman. True, position players are in better position to bet on themselves than pitchers, who face greater injury risk. But in 2019, Tatis’ only full season, he missed more than a month with a strained left hamstring and did not play after Aug. 13 because of a stress reaction in his lower back. He has yet to prove himself over a 162-game grind, not that anyone seriously thinks it will be a problem for him.

Still, think back to early in Carlos Correa’s career. He was the 2015 AL Rookie of the Year in his age 20 season and almost as impressive the following year. If he wasn’t quite Tatis, he was a reasonable facsimile. But back trouble and other injuries limited Correa to average just 98 games from 2017 to ’19. He then produced a career-low .709 OPS in the 60-game 2020 season, and his free agency after ’21 does not appear as promising as it once did.

The risk for the Padres is that Tatis might follow a similar path, or perhaps one like former center fielder Andruw Jones, another young phenom whose last big offensive season was at 29. If Tatis declined prematurely, the opportunity cost of his deal would be considerable, and the money he is guaranteed might prevent the team from making other moves. But the Padres struck now, believing Tatis’ price only would rise, and now was the time to ensure he remained in San Diego long-term.

(Opportunity cost, of course, works both ways. The Braves saved millions not just on Acuña, but also by signing second baseman Ozzie Albies to a seven-year, $35 million extension. They will have no excuse not to lock up first baseman Freddie Freeman, who is eligible for free agency after this season.)

Players sign extensions for different reasons, influenced perhaps by their parents, their agents, the circumstances in which they were born. Tatis removed all of his long-term risk while ensuring he would be among the game’s highest-paid players. The same cannot be said of Acuña, but what is the number at which a potential superstar is right to sacrifice dollars for security? Is it $150 million? $250 million? Higher?

Depends upon the player. But $340 million, it would seem, is plenty high enough.

Now what about Lindor?
The average fan might view Tatis’ contract as a measuring stick for Francisco Lindor and the other potential free-agent shortstops after the 2021 season – Correa, Javier Báez, Corey Seager and Trevor Story. The differences in ages and service times, however, make such comparisons apples and oranges.

Lindor, 27, is probably the most likely to sign an extension, and The Athletic’s Tim Britton last month explored what the terms might look like for the Mets. One rival executive agreed with Britton’s assessment that the most realistic comparison might be the eight-year, $260 million extension third baseman Nolan Arenado signed with the Rockies in February 2019.

Bryce Harper and Manny Machado signed free-agent contracts of $330 million and $300 million, respectively, entering their age 26 seasons. Lindor is in the same position Arenado was – one season from free agency, and poised to hit the market entering his age 28 season. An eight-year extension would take him through age 35, which also is the endpoint of Tatis’ deal. By that age, how many of those shortstops will still be playing the position?

Since 1995, the start of the wild-card era, only nine players age 32 or older have had more than two seasons of 500 or more plate appearances at shortstop. Four (Derek Jeter, Omar Vizquel, Jimmy Rollins and Barry Larkin) were either Hall of Famers or are in the Hall of Fame conversation.

Another issue: Lindor and other shortstops in his free-agent class will seek star-type money, and it’s exceptionally rare to get star-type performance out of shortstops approaching their mid-30s. The only two shortstops in the wild-card era who even produced more than one season worth 4.5 Wins Above Replacement, according to baseball-reference, were the two Hall of Famers, Jeter and Larkin.

Lindor averaged nearly 6 bWAR in his four full seasons from ages 22 to 25. Arenado averaged nearly 5 bWAR over the same stretch, from ages 25 to 28. While Arenado likely will stay at third base, Lindor eventually might move to second, which is generally a lower-paid position than short or third. Correa, Seager and Story, on the other hand, are more likely to end up at third.

Ah, but enough about the future uncertainty. The Mets will need to buy Lindor out of free agency and also account for his magnetism, which is on the level of Tatis’ and might make him an even bigger star in New York than he was in Cleveland. How does eight years, $280 million sound?

Braves pursued Rosenthal
The Braves lost Mark Melancon to the Padres and Darren O’Day to the Yankees in free agency. Another of their right-handed relievers from 2020, Shane Greene, remains on the open market. Perhaps, then, it is no surprise that the team continues to pursue bullpen help, recently exploring a back-loaded, two-year deal with free-agent closer Trevor Rosenthal, according to major-league sources.

Rosenthal instead agreed to a heavily deferred, one-year, $11 million contract with the A’s that will pay him $3 million in 2021, $3 million in ’22 and $5 million in ’23. The Braves’ offer was not at the same level, and a source close to Rosenthal said the right-hander was intrigued by the possibility of building his case for a multi-year deal at Oakland’s spacious RingCentral Coliseum, where the Athletics’ previous closers, Liam Hendriks and Blake Treinen, enjoyed success.

Earlier this offseason, the Braves also showed interest in free agent Kirby Yates, who signed a one-year, $5.5 million contract with the Blue Jays. They wanted to bring back Melancon and O’Day, as well as outfielder Adam Duvall, who signed a one-year, $5 million deal with the Marlins. But most of their allocated budget went to one-year deals for starting pitchers Charlie Morton and Drew Smyly, who will earn a combined $26 million in 2021, and outfielder Marcell Ozuna, who signed a four-year, $65 million deal.

Even though Ozuna’s deal is back-loaded, the Braves are down to less than $5 million of payroll flexibility in ’21, according to a source with knowledge of the team’s thinking. Club officials do not want to get caught in a budget crunch the way they did last season, when their only addition at the trade deadline was left-hander Tommy Milone. But they were willing to stretch for the upside of Rosenthal.

Why the Astros won’t sign Bradley Jr.
The financial penalty for exceeding the luxury-tax threshold is not what is deterring the Astros from signing free-agent center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. The team is more concerned with the diminished draft-pick compensation it would receive if it went past $210 million and then made qualifying offers to Correa and possibly right-handers Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke at the end of the season.

The Astros’ current luxury-tax payroll, according to Fangraphs, is $201.3 million, leaving them room for potential additions at the deadline. Bradley is unlikely to accept a salary that would keep them under the threshold. And if they go over, any compensation pick would fall from after the second round to after the fourth round. In 2019, the dropoff would have been from No. 78 to No. 138.

Going over also would cost the Astros young talent if they signed a free agent with a qualifying offer – say, Corey Seager to replace Correa. The penalty then would be their second- and fifth-highest picks and a $1 million reduction in their international bonus pool, as opposed to only a second-rounder and $500,000 reduction if they stayed under. And remember, every pick is critical for a team that lost its first- and second-round selections in 2020 and ’21 as part of its penalty for the sign-stealing scandal.

Correa seems certain to merit the one-year qualifying offer, which likely will be in the $18 million to $19 million range. Verlander, who is expected to miss the entire season after undergoing Tommy John surgery, would be an interesting call entering his age 39 season, as would Greinke entering his age 38. Righty Lance McCullers, 27, would be unlikely to receive a QO unless he has a big season.

Staying flexible in San Francisco
The Giants’ rotation includes five potential free agents – Johnny Cueto, Kevin Gausman, Anthony DeSclafani, Alex Wood and Aaron Sanchez. The development is partly by design, partly due to circumstance.

Cueto is in the final year of a six-year, $130 million contract that includes a $22 million club option for 2022. The other four starters all signed one-year deals, in some cases because they preferred to bet on themselves. The Giants, as they continue to retool, also were reluctant to subsidize the present with future commitments, and they were hardly alone in that stance.

Only three free-agent starting pitchers – Trevor Bauer, Mike Minor and Taijuan Walker – have agreed to multi-year contracts this offseason. Jake Odorizzi, who continues to linger on the open market, is seeking to be the fourth.

By staying flexible, the Giants are poised to strike when their payroll commitments drop from $151.1 million in 2021 to $30.7 million in ’22. They could re-sign one or more of their current starters and pursue others out of the deep free-agent class next offseason. Their ’22 rotation also might include Logan Webb and Tyler Beede, who underwent Tommy John surgery in March 2020, and prospects such as Seth Corry and Sean Hjelle might surface by then.

Around the horn
Information from major-league sources:

• The A’s made an impressive pivot after saving $9 million in 2021 payroll with the Khris Davis-Elvis Andrus trade ($2.75 million in the difference in salaries, $6.25 million in cash from the Rangers).

The one-year, free-agent contracts for right-handed starter Mike Fiers, first baseman Mitch Moreland and righty relievers Yusmeiro Petit and Sergio Romo add up to $10.55 million. The net add, though, is closer to $8.27 million, because each replaced a player projected to earn the minimum salary of $570,500.

The addition of Rosenthal required ownership approval, and the A’s might not end up paying his entire $11 million. Hard-throwing relievers always are in demand at the trade deadline. If the A’s fall out of contention, they can deal Rosenthal and possibly escape part or all of the combined $8 million he is owed in 2022 and ’23.

• The Braves have demonstrated a penchant for one-year, free-agent contracts, so it might seem odd they were willing to commit to Ozuna for four years after he lingered on the market into February. Club officials, however, wanted long-term protection knowing two of their most productive hitters, Freeman and catcher Travis d’Arnaud, are entering their walk years.

The potential losses of Ozuna, Freeman and d’Arnaud over a span of two offseasons was a terrifying notion to a team coming off three straight division titles. The club also views Ozuna as a positive influence on Acuña, and believes he will need to play defense for only one season if the players and owners agree to a universal DH in the next CBA.

• The breakout of Randy Arozarena in the 2020 postseason is one reason the Cardinals are so eager to create greater opportunities for their younger outfielders. Arozarena had only 23 plate appearances in the majors before the Cardinals traded him to the Rays, and the team does not want to pass judgment on players such as Lane Thomas and Justin Williams without giving them a better chance.

Club officials wanted to begin the transition to younger outfielders more fully in 2020, but the 60-game season made evaluations difficult. For ’21, they accelerated the process by trading Dexter Fowler to the Angels, even though it required them paying $12.75 million of his remaining $14.5 million salary, plus the remaining $2 million of his signing bonus.

The move with Fowler opened right field for top prospect Dylan Carlson. Harrison Bader will be in center, and Thomas and Williams likely will compete with Tyler O’Neill for playing time in left.

• Come 2022, the Marlins also might be ready to turn to younger outfielders. Starling Marte and Corey Dickerson are potential free agents, and Adam Duvall will become one as well if either he or the club declines its end of his $7 million mutual option.

Thus, it’s critical the Marlins learn more this season about their deep crop of young outfielders, whose developments – like those of all prospects – were hindered by the cancellation of the 2020 minor-league season.

While the Marlins’ depth of young starting pitchers is well-documented, six of their top 20 prospects are outfielders, according to The Athletic’s Keith Law. The group starts at No. 5 with JJ Bleday, the fourth overall pick out of Vanderbilt in the 2019 draft. Jesús Sánchez (No. 8) and Monte Harrison (No. 13) already have played in the majors, as have Magneuris Sierra and Lewis Brinson, who have graduated from prospect lists.

• And finally, free-agent outfielder Yoenis Céspedes intends to play in 2021, and will hold a showcase for major-league clubs on March 2 in Fort Pierce, Fl.

Céspedes, 35, opted out of the 2020 season after only eight games for what former Mets GM Brodie Van Wagenen called “COVID-related reasons.” Hampered by injuries, he has appeared in a total of only 127 games since 2016.
