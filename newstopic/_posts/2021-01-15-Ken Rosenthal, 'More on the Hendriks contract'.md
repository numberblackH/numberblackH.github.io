[Rosenthal: Realmuto to Astros unlikely; Hendriks’ contract; Padres consider more arms](https://theathletic.com/2320163/2021/01/13/rosenthal-realmuto-to-astros-unlikely-hendriks-contract-padres-consider-more-arms/) &mdash; <The Athletic, Ken Rosenthal>

Liam Hendrik's contract   
: signing bonus - 1M
: 2021 - 11M      
: 2022 - 13M
: 2023 - 14M
: 2024 - 15M(club option) or 15M(buyout)   

Hendriks, who turns 32 on Feb. 10, is guaranteed $54 million, starting with $39 million over the first three years. If the White Sox exercise a club option, they will pay him $15 million for a fourth season. If not, they will pay him $1.5 million annually for 10 years, a buyout that is for the same amount as the option, though not the same present-day value.

The contract includes one other twist: The option will become guaranteed if Hendriks is traded at any point during the deal. The agreement, which is pending a physical, grants Hendriks complete no-trade protection in the first year, a 10-team no-trade list in the second and a five-team no-trade list in the third.

: 2021년 전체 거부권
: 2022년 10팀 거부권
: 2023년 5팀 거부권

NBA deals include such provisions for salary-cap purposes, and Hendriks’ contract would include a luxury-tax benefit, a charge of zero in year four, assuming a luxury tax is even part of the next CBA. The current deal expires on Dec. 1; a new agreement might include higher thresholds, or introduce a new economic system entirely.

The White Sox are far enough away from the current thresholds that they did not worry about the $18 million hit in their luxury-tax payroll for each of Hendriks’ first three years. The structure of the deal enables them to bridge Hendriks’ desire for a fourth guaranteed year with their desire for protection, through deferred payments, if he is injured or ineffective entering that season.

사치세 부분이 가장 궁금했는데 로젠탈은 이렇게 설명합니다   
새로운 CBA 부분으로 추측하는거 같은데 첫 3년동안 매년 18M의 사치세, 그리고 마지막 1년(2024년) 0M의 사치세 적용
