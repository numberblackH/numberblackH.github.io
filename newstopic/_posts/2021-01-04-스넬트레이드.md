[Blake Snell stunned but excited by move to San Diego Padres as trade finalized]

Snell said he was stunned and saddened to leave Tampa Bay. He anticipated the Rays trading him before his contract expired, because the small-budget franchise was unlikely to commit to a long-term deal. But he hardly expected the move to come this soon.

"The Padres really wanted me, and they were persistent, and I'm happy about that," Snell said. "But it is something I am sad about."

Even if command has some relationship with a pitcher’s ability to pitch deeper into games, and their viability as a starter, you can see that Tyler Glasnow is also on that list. The Rays had some success tightening up his attack regions and making the most of his stuff with a simple plan. Maybe they can do the same with Patiño with the right mix and approach.

Francisco Mejía checks a box that the Rays need at the catcher position. But like Patiño, he might do one thing well enough (he’s at least projected to be a league-average catcher offensively), but with some questions on the other end. He was 31st among 70 catchers by Statcast’s framing metric and was in the bottom quartile by FanGraphs defensive stats over the last three seasons.

But Mejía made sense as a catcher that could play for the Rays in Tampa on Day 1 next season — Luis Campusano might have had more upside, and that’s why he was involved in some trade predictions, but the catcher is in the middle of some legal problems and hasn’t had as much adjustment time in the major leagues.

Will Blake Hunt and Cole Wilcox end up good enough to make up for the risk that neither Patiño and Mejía hit their marks? That’s for Keith to help us figure out — but it does matter. There’s a decent likelihood that neither of the main pieces the Rays get back will be much more than role players.
