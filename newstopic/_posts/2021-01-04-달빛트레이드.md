Preciado, 17, might have the highest ceiling of the group after signing out of Panama in 2019. A 6-foot-4 shortstop who received $1.6 million, a record bonus for the country, he is a toolsy, switch-hitting athlete who international scouts believe was one of the best players in his signing class.

Caissie, another under-the-radar prospect, was a darling of computer models in the 2020 draft because of his age (he just turned 18), exit velocities (triple digits) and relative inexperience (he's from Ontario, Canada). Like Brennen Davis, the Cubs' top prospect, Caissie is a 6-foot-4 outfielder with excellent speed and athleticism -- and is the second top 2020 pick the Padres have traded in two days, with third-round bonus baby Cole Wilcox heading to Tampa Bay in the Snell trade.

The potential with Santana was clear in 2019, when he slashed .346/.429/.494 at 18 in the rookie-level Arizona League. Now 20, he is expected by scouts to stay at shortstop.

Mena signed in the same class as Preciado -- and for $600,000 more, at $2.2 million. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, he's a classic A.J. Preller prospect -- full of tools and, if they develop, a star. He's the sort of player the Cubs need as their homegrown core nears free agency and the Cubs of 2016 become a distant memory.

The Padres leveraged the Rays’ cost-cutting ways to acquire Snell, a former Cy Young winner with three seasons of remaining control. San Diego surrendered its No. 2 prospect but overall made out well, according to talent evaluators around the sport. The Padres then leveraged the big-market Cubs’ turn toward austerity to acquire Darvish, who arguably should have won the 2020 National League Cy Young Award. Darvish, too, is under contract for three more seasons. All of the prospects San Diego exchanged for him are years from the majors, if they ever make it there.

A rebuild, yes, but there are different versions of that. Just because Hoyer collected a bunch of unproven teens for an actual adult pitcher doesn’t mean they’re the core of the rebuild and everyone should wait four to five years for a competitive team again. A healthy organization has talent up and down its system. After a lost season of development, it’s hard to gauge where they’re at right now.

The Cubs are clearly prioritizing payroll flexibility and long-term sustainability over winning big in 2021. As the Padres GM who once demanded that the Red Sox include Rizzo in the Adrián González trade — and Theo Epstein’s longtime No. 2 executive in Chicago — Hoyer knows the opportunities for a seller and the costs that come with win-now deals. After mortgaging their farm system to make the playoffs five times in the last six years, the Cubs are focusing on the future.

Maybe all the changes in scouting and player development will pay big dividends, though it’s hard to tell since there was no minor-league season in 2020. As a rookie manager, David Ross demonstrated real leadership abilities as the Cubs continued to get results out of their pitching infrastructure at the big-league level. Throughout Hoyer’s baseball operations department, there are talented staffers with World Series rings.

Words like “rebuild” have been dismissed and perhaps that will turn out to be too harsh an assessment. Ideally, the Cubs would like to look at 2021 as a sort of reset, a year to bring more youth into the organization while also accomplishing such goals as creating financial flexibility. But buzzwords like efficiency or sustainability aren’t going to appeal to fans who have gotten used to the Cubs putting out a perennial playoff team.

Rather than continue to push toward a goal that Hoyer felt wasn’t realistic for 2021, he chose a reset. Hoyer has decided a step back now would be best for the long-term health of the organization.

“As we come to the end of (this run), it’s really important to think about the future,” Hoyer said. “I think there are plenty of examples of teams that were able to have a small reset or make a move in that direction that really helped them. The Yankees and the Red Sox, in particular, I’d use them as examples. There are teams that never had that opportunity or chose not to take it. The Giants and the Phillies and the Tigers would be those examples. As we come to the end of this run, as we’ve invested so much financial and prospect capital in this group, I think that former group is the group I’d want to be in and not the latter group, as far as how the post-window transition looked.”
