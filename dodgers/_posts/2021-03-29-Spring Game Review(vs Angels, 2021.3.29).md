### Price, Pollock ill
Price wasn’t the only player scratched from Sunday's game late due to an illness. Outfielder AJ Pollock was scheduled to play left field in the Dodgers’ original lineup, but he told the team he was feeling a bit sick. Roberts said Pollock let the team know that he could play, but the team opted against it, preferring instead to ensure the outfielder was ready for the season. DJ Peters started in Pollock's absence.

Price만이 질병때문에 게임에서 빠진 것이 아닙니다. 외야수 AJ Pollock은 좌익수로 출전한 예정이었으나, 그는 약간 몸이 좋지 않음을 느꼈다고 말했습니다. Roberts는 Pollock이 뛸 수 있다고 했으나, 팀은 거절했고, 대신 시즌을 준비하는 것을 선호했씁니다. DJ Peters는 Pollock을 대신해서 출전했습니다.

### Gonsolin's outing
With Price scratched, Tony Gonsolin, who was scheduled to pitch Sunday in relief, got the start against the Angels.

Price가 스크래치를 냈고, 일요일 릴리버로 던질 계획이었던 Tony Gonsolin이 에인절스를 상대로 선발 등판했습니다.

그의 스프링 2번째 선발 등판이었고, Gonsolin은 3 1/3 이닝 동안 8개의 피안타를 허용했고 4실점(2자책)을 했습니다. Gonsolin은 6삼진과 3볼넷을 기록했습니다. 86구(52S)를 던졌습니다.
