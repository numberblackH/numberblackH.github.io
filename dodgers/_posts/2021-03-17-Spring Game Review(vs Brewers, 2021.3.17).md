### Bellinger debuts with new stance: 'Felt great'
Cody Bellinger took his first Cactus League at-bats since undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder over the offseason, and there was a noticeable difference in the Dodgers outfielder’s batting stance.

Cody Bellinger는 지난 오프시즌 우측 어깨 수술 이후에 처음으로 스프링 캠프 리그에 출전했고, 타격 자세에 눈에 보이는 차이가 있었습니다.

Bellinger is still standing straight up, but his stance was clearly more open than it was during the 2020 season. The batting stance he broke out during the Dodgers’ 7-2 loss to the Brewers on Tuesday was closer to what it looked like during the '17 season, the year he took home National League Rookie of the Year honors.

Bellinger는 여전히 똑바로 서있지만, 그의 스탠스는 2020년 시즌보다 더 열려있습니다. 7-2로 브루어스를 상대로 한 화요일 경기에서 그의 모습은 NL 신인왕을 탔던 17 시즌과 비슷해 보였습니다.

“It felt good. I felt really good,” Bellinger said. “Shoulder felt great and just felt good to get into a game again with the guys in front of some fans.”

"느낌이 좋아요, 나는 정말 좋았어요, 어깨 느낌도 좋았고 게임에서 팀원들과 팬들 앞에서 게임을 하는게 좋았어요." Bellinger가 말했습니다.

### Kershaw and Bauer take the mound
Having two former Cy Young Award winners pitch for the same team in one game doesn’t happen often, but that’s exactly what the Dodgers did on Tuesday with Clayton Kershaw getting the start and Trevor Bauer pitching behind him out of the bullpen.

Cy Young 듀오가 같은 팀에서 한 게임에 던지는 것은 보통 일어나지 않아요, 화요일 Clayton Kershaw가 선발로 나오고 이어서 Trevor Bauer가 이어던졌습니다.

Kershaw, who is the team’s Opening Day starter for the ninth time, struggled to find success. The left-hander gave up back-to-back homers to Kolten Wong and Luis Urías to start the game, including Wong jumping on the very first pitch of the game. Kershaw allowed five runs on eight hits in his outing, but he was able to continue building up, throwing 72 pitches (46 for strikes) over four innings of work.

팀의 오프닝 데이 선발로 9번째 나설 Kershaw는 성공을 위해 고전했습니다. 그는 경기 첫 공을 홈런으로 연결한 Kolten Wong 그리고 Luis Urías에게 백투백 홈런을 허용했습니다. Kershaw는 마운드에서 내려가기 전에 8개의 안타와 5실점을 했지만, 그는 4이닝 동안 72구(46S)를 던졌습니다.

“Not great. Not a lot of positives,” Kershaw said. “Just gotta keep going [and] figure it out.”

"좋지는 않았어요. 긍정적인 많지도 않았어요. 단지 나아가려 할뿐입니다." Kershaw가 말했습니다.

Bauer, on the other hand, was sharp in his fourth outing of the spring, striking out seven and allowing two runs over five innings of work. Bauer retired the first six hitters he faced, including five consecutive strikeouts after getting his first batter to ground out. He struck out the side in the sixth inning and followed it by doing the "Conor McGregor" walk as he went back to the home dugout. Bauer threw 68 pitches.

이와 반대로, Bauer는 이번 봄 4번째 등판이 좋았어요, 7개의 삼진과 5이닝을 던지는 동안 2점을 허용했습니다. Bauer는 첫 6명의 타자를 5개의 연속 삼진과 땅볼 아웃으로 잡아냈습니다. 그는 68구를 던졌습니다.

“Trevor was good,” Roberts said. “He used all of his pitches. I thought he got ahead of guys the entire outing. Really professional outing.”

"Trevor는 좋았어요, 그는 그의 모든 구종을 사용했어요. 나는 그가 다른 투수들보다 페이스가 좋다고 생각해요. 정말 훌륭한 등판이었어요." Roberts가 말했습니다.
