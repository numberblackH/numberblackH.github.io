### Luke Raley was the 11th future major leaguer chosen in a class with Gavin Lux, Will Smith, Dustin May and others
Consider, then, the shadow of the Dodgers’ 1968 draft class. It was only their fourth draft ever, and it produced 16 future major leaguers: Steve Garvey, Ron Cey, Davey Lopes, Bill Buckner, Bobby Valentine, Tom Paciorek, Doyle Alexander, Sandy Vance, Mike Pazik, Geoff Zahn, Bob Randall, Ed Crosby, Joe Ferguson, Bob Gallagher, Ed Ott and Bob Sheldon. Not all of them became household names, but six became All-Stars who combined to make 23 All-Star Game appearances ― the all-time record for a single draft class.

다저스의 1968 드래프트 뒷 모습을 생각해보세요. 그들의 4번째 드래프트였고, 16명의 메이저리거를 만들어냈습니다:Steve Garvey, Ron Cey, Davey Lopes, Bill Buckner, Bobby Valentine, Tom Paciorek, Doyle Alexander, Sandy Vance, Mike Pazik, Geoff Zahn, Bob Randall, Ed Crosby, Joe Ferguson, Bob Gallagher, Ed Ott and Bob Sheldon. 그들 모두가 유명하지는 않지만, 6명이 올스타가 되었고 이들은 총 23번의 ASG에 출전했으며 이것은 단일 드래프트 올 타임 기록입니다.

The Dodgers did not receive a trophy for winning the ’68 draft. Maybe they should have.

다저스는 68 드래프트로 타이틀을 따내지는 못했습니다. 아마 그들은 그랬어야 했습니다.

Raley(seventh round) and Colorado Rockies pitcher Jordan Sheffield(supplemental first round) debuted this month. Last year, Dodgers outfielder Zach McKinstry(33rd round) and pitcher Mitch White(second round), Houston Astros pitcher Andre Scrubb(eighth round), and Baltimore Orioles pitcher Dean Kremer(14th round) made their major league debuts.

They were preceded by a quartet of Dodgers regulars – Gavin Lux(first round), Will Smith(supplemental first round), Dustin May(third round), Tony Gonsolin(ninth round) – and Twins pitcher Devin Smeltzer(fifth round).

정말 많은 선수들이 메이저리그에 도달했고 데뷔에 근접한 선수들이 더 있습니다: Luke Raley(7 round), Jordan Sheffield(supplemental 1 round), Zach McKinstry(33 round), Mitch White(2 round), Andre Scrubb(8 round), Dean Kremer(14 round), Gavin Lux(1 round), Will Smith(supplemental 1 round), Dustin May(3 round), Tony Gonsolin(9 round), Devin Smeltzer(5 round)

“You feel proud because you’re responsible as a group for drafting a player, but there’s a little guilt it’s with another team that’s competing against us,” he said. “There’s this guilty feeling of being happy. Our talent bar with our major league team is so high, so good. At some level, you feel good for the kid to get a chance somewhere else. We’re outrageously talented at the big league level, so it’s hard.”

"우리가 드래프트했던 선수들에 대하여 책임감이 있기 떄문에 자랑스럽게 느낄지 모르겠지만, 우리 팀과 경쟁해야되는 다른 팀들보다는 약간의 죄책감이 존재합니다. 우리 팀 선수들의 재능 수준은 엄청 높아요, 그래서 좋아요. 어느 정도 레벨에 도달한 아이가 다른 팀에서 기회를 받게 된다면 기분이 좋아요. 우리 팀의 빅 리그 수준의 재능이 너무 높아서, 어려워요." Gasparino가 말했습니다.

[In a Sept. 2019 interview](https://www.ocregister.com/2019/09/05/the-dodgers-2016-draft-class-already-looks-like-a-big-winner/), Gasparino predicted “11 or 12” players he drafted in 2016 might ultimately reach the major leagues. Now, that number seems conservative.

2019년 9월 인터뷰, "2016년 드래프트된 선수들 중에 11 또는 12명이 메이저리그에 도달할거에요." Gasparino가 인터뷰 중에 말했습니다. 현재, 이 수치는 보수적으로 보입니다.
