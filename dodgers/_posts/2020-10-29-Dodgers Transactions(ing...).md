The Dodgers declined a 2021 contract option on right-hander Jimmy Nelson, who is now a free agent. Nelson did not pitch in 2020 because of back surgery.

Nelson was signed last offseason to a contract paying $750,000 with a 2021 option for $2 million or a $500,000 buyout. He was signed to provide starting pitching depth. -- October 30, 2020
