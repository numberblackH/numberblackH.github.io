The Dodgers declined a 2021 contract option on right-hander Jimmy Nelson, who is now a free agent. Nelson did not pitch in 2020 because of back surgery.

Nelson was signed last offseason to a contract paying $750,000 with a 2021 option for $2 million or a $500,000 buyout. He was signed to provide starting pitching depth.

지미넬슨은 $500000를 받고 FA가 됩니다. 싼 복권인데 아무것도 못했죠.

JT는 4년전에 QO를 4년전에 받았고 다저스와 4년 계약을 했습니다. 올해 다저스는 FA가 되는 어떤 선수에게도 QO를 하지않았습니다. (2021년 $18.9M)
