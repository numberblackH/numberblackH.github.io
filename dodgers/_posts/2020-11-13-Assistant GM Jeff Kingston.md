Kingston was hired by the Dodgers during the winter of 2018, filling the vacancy of Assistant General Manager and Vice President. The Dodgers hired him on as part of the departure of Farhan Zaidi, at which point Andrew Friedman took over the General Manager duties.

Kingston은 2018년 겨울 다저스에 고용되었으며, 부단장과 부사장의 빈 자리를 채웠습니다. 다저스는 자히디가 떠나면서 그를 고용했고, 프리드먼이 사장이 되었습니다.

The Dodgers hired Jeff Kingston away from the Seattle Mariners where he had spent 9 years previously. Kingston also served as the Padres director of baseball operations for several years before that.

다저스는 매리너스에서 9년을 보낸 Jeff Kingston을 고용했습니다. Kingston은 또한 파드레스에서 디렉터로 지난 몇 년간 일을 했습니다.

In terms of the future, it’s unclear if the Dodgers have any intention of moving back to a more traditional front-office structure. Zaidi leaving for San Francisco left them in a spot where they have no true General Manager, but it does not seem like they are headed toward filling that position any time soon.

장기적으로 볼 때 다저스가 더 전통적인 프론트 오피스 구조로 돌아갈 의도가 있는지는 불분명합니다. 샌프란시스코로 자히디가 떠나고 그들은 진정한 GM을 공석으로 남겨두었지만, 그들이 곧 그 자리를 채우는 쪽으로 향하고 있는 것 같지는 않습니다.
