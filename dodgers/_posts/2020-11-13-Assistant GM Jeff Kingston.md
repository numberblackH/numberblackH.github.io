Kingston was hired by the Dodgers during the winter of 2018, filling the vacancy of Assistant General Manager and Vice President. The Dodgers hired him on as part of the departure of Farhan Zaidi, at which point Andrew Friedman took over the General Manager duties.

The Dodgers hired Jeff Kingston away from the Seattle Mariners where he had spent 9 years previously. Kingston also served as the Padres director of baseball operations for several years before that.

In terms of the future, itâ€™s unclear if the Dodgers have any intention of moving back to a more traditional front-office structure. Zaidi leaving for San Francisco left them in a spot where they have no true General Manager, but it does not seem like they are headed toward filling that position any time soon.
