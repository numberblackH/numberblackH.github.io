> Why you can't shift on LeMahieu

Mike Petriello(Mike Petriello is an analyst for MLB.com)분석가가 쓴 칼럼의 부분입니다. [Why you can't shift on LeMahieu](https://www.mlb.com/news/why-you-cant-shift-on-dj-lemahieu/)옆 링크로 원본을 볼 수있습니다.
간단히 필요한것만 요약하겠습니다.

5년간 단 2회라고합니다.

The last "real" shift we could find came back on July 18, 2016, when the Rays did it to him for a handful of pitches in Coors Field.

Lowest percent of pitches with a shift on, 2016-20 (active players at least 2,500 pitches over the last five seasons)

0.0% -- LeMahieu
0.1% -- Dee Strange-Gordon
0.1% -- Miguel Rojas
0.2% -- Isiah Kiner-Falefa
0.2% -- Jean Segura
0.2% -- Chris Owings
0.2% -- Christian Vázquez
0.2% -- Orlando Arcia
0.2% -- Travis Jankowski
```

마지막 시프트는 2016년 7월 18일 쿠어스 필드

최근 5년간 시프트는 계속해서 증가했고, 좌타자에게는 무려 51% 증가했다는 사진 자료입니다.

```
After all, he does have a Top 10 Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) of qualified hitters over the last five years, and he's not exactly known for his blazing foot speed.
```

![As he told MLB.com in 2017](https://www.mlb.com/rockies/news/dj-lemahieu-beats-shift-flirts-with-cycle-c253812390), "I try to just block it out, hit the ball hard. If they're there, they're there. Hopefully, they're not."
