### Short Sellers; 공매도
파산 신청한 기업 주식에 공매도가 몰리게 됩니다. 지금이 얼마든 이론적으로 0원이 될 주식이니 공매도 하지 않을 이유가 없습니다

### Short Squeeze
공매도 포지션을 청산하기 위해 해당 주식을 Cover(매수)하는 물량이 많을수록 오히려 공매도 세력에 의한 매수세 때문에 주가가 올라가는 현상

### 8-K NYSE(뉴욕증권거래소)에서 날아온 상장 폐지 경고장(8-K)
Item 3.01.	Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

On May 26, 2020, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) received a letter from the staff of NYSE Regulation, Inc. (“NYSE Regulation”) that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist the common stock of the Company from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). NYSE Regulation reached its decision that the Company is no longer suitable for listing pursuant to NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 802.01D after the Company’s disclosure on May 22, 2020 that it has commenced voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company appealed the determination in a timely manner and requested a hearing before the NYSE. At this time, the common stock of the Company will continue to be listed and trade on the NYSE pending resolution of such appeal. There can be no assurance that the NYSE will grant the Company’s request for continued listing at the hearing and whether there will be equity value in the Company’s common stock.
