As the end of the year approaches, we all consider ourselves in past and future form. Have we been going about it all wrong? Should we change things up? What part of our daily process should we update in order to become better versions in the future? How do we continue to develop?

On that sort of train of thought, we once asked about player development, and the question was: What if we’re wrong about what we think is the right way to develop a player? We once thought everyone should chop wood at the plate and run poles to have a pitcher’s body, but now we think lifting the ball is better, and pitchers should develop in order to be able to perform in short bursts. What if we look back in 10 years and laugh at the current beliefs of coaching in baseball?

But there’s another version of this question, and it’s just as important: What if we’re all right? What if we’ve actually got something figured out? This isn’t an open system like real life, where we could all decide that working out and eating healthfully is good and therefore all get in better shape — in baseball, it’s a closed system. If everyone does the same thing, it will, at some point, make sense to do something different just to do something different.

The philosopher Georg Hegel created a method of logic called the dialectical method that points to the inevitability of such a thing happening in baseball, because that is how we argue things, and that is how we progress through thought as human beings. In his “Phenomenology of Spirit,” published in 1807, Hegel put together this oft-cited word bomb:

The skepticism which ends with the abstraction “nothing” or “emptiness” can advance from this not a step farther, but must wait and see whether there is possibly anything new offered, and what that is — in order to cast it into the same abysmal void. When once, on the other hand, the result is apprehended, as it truly is, as determinate negation, a new form has thereby immediately arisen; and in the negation the transition is made by which the progress through the complete succession of forms comes about of itself.

It’s dense, but it lays out a process for debate in which we debate two ideas, throw one into the abyss, and continue on with our idea, and another one that we may throw into the abyss later. To make things a little more simple, consider the process of defining what an apple is. In that process, we’d be required at some point to think about or define what an apple is not. We could discard the “not-apple” once we form a consensus about what an apple is, but to some extent that not-apple still exists within the concept of the apple.

So how does this play out in baseball? Is it useful to consider baseball this way? The concept being defined is probably “the best way to run a baseball team,” and it does seem like baseball has cycled through at least a couple of ideas and either discarded paths to success or enveloped them, as the sport has moved on to new consensuses over time.

Branch Rickey once introduced the idea of a minor league farm system, and teams quickly fell into line around the idea that scouting good players was the way to have a good team. Then think about the Moneyball days, in which a new concept of data-driven player acquisition rose up in opposition to a more scout-driven approach. Moneyball was always there — Rickey himself created OPS and famously tracked stats. But when Moneyball arrived as a concept that was written about, baseball’s data-first and scouting-first approaches lived in opposition for a while.

If you ask any executive in baseball today, the best teams now use both data and scouting to make decisions. There’s a new consensus about “the best way to run a baseball team,” at least when it comes to these high-level concepts. So what is the new form that has arisen in baseball, if the dialectic model applies?

What has emerged as a “new way” in today’s landscape is probably a reliance on data and tech in the process of developing your own players to best of their abilities — a new Moneyball if you will. And once again, every executive will perform lip service to the importance of player development, but how close are we to a consensus on this?

If you just look at the structures needed, it might seem we are close. College programs with biomechanics labs are ubiquitous, and their coaches (and approaches) are heading to the big leagues in droves.

“If you looked at universities that have access to a biomechanics lab on campus and they’re starting to implement that — the number of biomechanics labs (at schools) with baseball teams is easily in the hundreds,” said Driveline Baseball’s Anthony Brady on a recent podcast I appeared on. “Now it’s about the coach seeing biomechanics is being popularized, and they have a lab, and then connecting with the professor. But actually doing something with it is not really there.”

There is a difference between having the tech and implementing it. But Driveline itself is an interesting test case, as their popularity has exploded recently, their coaches are being hired by organizations everywhere, and those same teams are sending their players to get assessed and trained at Driveline’s new premises.

“In terms of players, we’ve probably assessed or trained a player from each team,” said Driveline’s Alex Caravan on that same podcast. “But it’s completely different in terms of some teams sending dozens of players, or sending players multiple times in the year.”

“In terms of teams actively sending players here, it’s a half to two-thirds maybe,” Brady said.

That may not seem like it’s far from all of baseball agreeing on this new form of player development, but a further look at a core concept within player development might be instructive. Pitch design is the idea that, using research on what makes a pitch good in terms of movement and velocity, coaches can help a pitcher optimize their various pitches and get better. It’s a foundational part of player development in general, and specifically at Driveline. Is it everywhere? Is it time for a new idea to arise?

“Very far off if were talking real quality of process and output,” thought one player development executive. “Ten years out maybe. I don’t think it’s close because I don’t think many organizations currently do it, and an even smaller population do it well or consistently. Just not represented in the organization samples of pitch progressions from last full season or instructs that I’ve run.”

Minor league players, en masse, may not be showing the effects of pitch design yet, but is it possible that major league players are? Take a look at how the average pitch types have changed, in terms of movement and velocity, for left-handed pitchers since 2015.

The table is almost identical for righties — players are getting more sink and velo on their pitches, and this is just in the last five years. Here’s the weird thing, though: The swinging strike rate on breaking balls in 2015 was 15.2 percent. In 2020, that number was 15.4 percent. Pitchers have added an inch of drop and made their pitches theoretically better — yet there’s been no functional change in results on the field.

As teams move pitchers closer to better shapes on their breaking balls, they’ll also move the means that are used to define what a good pitch is. Maybe it’s not surprising, then, that despite adding an inch or so of sink to their collective breaking balls, pitchers are seeing the same whiff rate? If everyone adds an inch of drop, the league average re-sets to that new number, that new mean that drives the pitch design metrics. The new consensus is the same as the old consensus?

This probably isn’t evidence enough that every team is doing pitch design effectively, and that it’s therefore already time, in a Hegelian way, to consider a new way of getting better. There will be time for that, but enough teams still have work to do to get up to speed on this current method of finding success in baseball.

“They weren’t ready for me,” said one analyst of a certain team. “I think about weird future stuff and they needed someone to just get the data process cleaned up.”

But the best teams are probably already thinking about the weird stuff. You can do that when you have seven times as many research and development analysts in your organization as the bottom-shelf R&D departments do, which is currently the case if you compare the Yankees and Dodgers to the bottom of the league.

Even within pitch design, though, every team can find in this digression something useful to implement. If you define what a good slider is by looking at your pitchers’ results and contours on a graph, and then ask your pitchers to throw sliders more like those sliders, which in turn changes the overall results and contours on the graph, you’ll enter a cyclical and nonsensical spiral in which your pitchers are “getting better” but also staying the same. You’ll get caught looking too hard at your own sample, for one.

“(Teams) can get caught within their own data,” said Brady. “If they only collect data on that team, in that organization, whatever is being taught there, if it’s being taught top to bottom, that’s what you’re going to see. You’re going to bring that person in, train them a certain way, and then say all of our best guys do this, but you don’t know what’s going on in other orgs. When we’ve gone and done mobile assessments — especially the case when we went to Japan — the underlying signal was a very different type of thrower place to place, there were things that stuck out kinematically by region and team.”

So it’s important to cast your net wide enough so that you don’t start turning out just one type of pitcher. It’s important to be different.

“We talk about being different,” said Kyle Lindley on the Driveline podcast. “To be good is to have good stuff but also to be different from the norm. You develop patterns and if someone doesn’t fall into that pattern, they’re going to be hard to hit. If you focus on being different — paying attention to the mean, and the mean will be changing as people adopt processes — if you do a good enough job of prioritizing being different, your propensity to be successful is probably pretty great for the long term.”

So maybe that’s the new concept that will rise up as baseball coalesces around pitch design and data-driven player development: being different. In general, the dialectic structure and this thought should be a comfort to anyone who looks at baseball today and sees too much of the same thing — at some point, organizations will understand the value of being different.

Maybe that’s why, as the sinker is being used less and less around the league (down by over a third in the past 10 years), the World Champion Dodgers just threw more sinkers than anyone in baseball last year, and nearly double what they threw four years ago? They probably have a few people thinking about the weird stuff upstairs.
