In early 2019, Major League Baseball visited spring training camps with a new, buzzed-about toy: a sticky baseball. The baseballs, which weren’t the exact ones used (and often hailed by pitchers) in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) or the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO), were rolled out and given to groups of MLB pitchers and hitters to try out. Spring is ripe for experiment and during those same camps, players at various sites also tinkered with bigger bases and wrist devices for catchers.

The sticky ball experiment didn’t go well. Many could barely remember the sticky balls — made by Rawlings, MLB’s official partner — being showcased at camp. A few who did thought they were hollow, the quality compromised. One coach said hitters quickly told him to stop throwing them because “they were total shit.”

While there were no new prototypes last spring, MLB has worked with Rawlings for years on testing to find a solution to one of the game’s constant, oft-criticized problems: pitchers illegally using sticky substances to doctor baseballs.

The Athletic heard estimates from a variety of sources that more than three-quarters of the league likely uses a grip substance — from a combination of sunscreen and rosin to more carefully engineered products that sometimes require boiling down sodas. They’re used for better grip, more spin and are either a safety precaution or unfair advantage, depending on who you talk to.

The issue of sticky substances isn’t new, and whether MLB should turn up the enforcement efforts, allow it more explicitly, or continue to turn a blind eye toward its rampant use has been debated for years. That debate is back in the spotlight now as former Angels clubhouse attendant Brian “Bubba” Harkins named more than a dozen big-league pitchers — including Gerrit Cole, Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander — who used his special ball-doctoring blend, according to filings in the Orange County Superior Court last week.

Is ball doctoring a form of cheating? Yes, technically it’s in violation of Rule 3.01. Is it prevalent enough that teams don’t enforce the rules on opponents because of what’s going on in their own backyard? Also yes.

Instead of the league legalizing pitchers using pine tar, which presents its own set of challenges, one answer seems simple: Why not adopt the successful sticky baseballs of other leagues? The Japanese ball, for example, is slightly smaller and comes out of the wrapper already tacky.

“I didn’t use pine tar all year,” an MLB pitcher said of his time in the KBO. “I didn’t need to, because I could grip the ball just fine.”

Pitcher Dan Straily, who signed a one-year deal this winter to remain with the KBO, has also been a proponent of the stickier baseballs, which are made by Mizuno. Getting them to MLB, however, faces significant hurdles. Most notably, Rawlings has been MLB’s official ball for more than 40 years, so implementing the exact balls used in Japan and Korea is not an immediate option.

“We’ve been working with Rawlings to develop a kind of pre-tacked baseball that doesn’t require mud application,” MLB’s executive vice president of baseball operations Morgan Sword said in December of 2019. “That is a fairly long process, one, to develop a product that’s suitable, and then to get it in the hands of players and coaches to test it.”

The long-term testing (MLB did not use any sticky balls in spring training games in 2019) has been going on in trials with the Arizona Fall League and the independent Atlantic League. (There was no discussion of experimenting with a sticky baseball in a shortened 2020 season, given the early feedback and consistency issues.)

Though the public doesn’t have access to that data, it seems that there’s good news and some bad news in those trials.

Sources say the bounciness of the ball, as measured by the Batted Ball Coefficient Of Restitution, is about the same as the current pro baseball — but that work still needs to be done to nail down the drag coefficient, or how easily the ball flies through the air. And, given how much the drag coefficient has oscillated on the ball in the last five years, and how much that has affected the league-wide home run rate, that might not be an easy lift.

Remember: Even if Rawlings developed the best sticky ball on the market, both hitters and pitchers would have to agree to it, meaning the feel of throwing it would matter just as much as any potential effect on the offensive side of things.

The league knows that buy-in from players is important, and that ball doctoring becoming more and more public puts more pressure on them to find a solution. Commissioner Rob Manfred met with free agent Trevor Bauer about this issue before the 2020 season, multiple sources told The Athletic, and Bauer met again with other Major League Baseball officials.

Why him? Bauer has been outspoken on pine tar giving pitchers an unfair advantage, and has gone so far as to do a very public experiment in the first inning of a 2018 game to show the effect of pine tar on pitches — more spin, and therefore more movement. Bauer at this point may have ascribed to the motto “if you can’t beat them, join them”; those who are against legalizing it often point to his fastball spin rate (highest of his career in 2020) and his Cy Young season as proof of sticky stuff’s results.

But ball doctoring isn’t the only form of cheating involving sticky substances happening in the sport. Hitters, who are allowed to use pine tar for grip, are testing the legal limits too. Multiple sources told The Athletic that some hitters are spraying sticky substances on the barrel of their bats, much further along the bat than the 18-inches from the knob that MLB’s official rules allow. For what reason? Increased backspin is one theory. Potential distance is another.

Similar to pitchers’ sticky concoctions, what hitters spray on their bats is rarely policed unless it becomes obvious. (Even then, there’s the unwritten rule of a club being exposed for their own rule-bending if they try to tell on an opponent).

The sticky bats aren’t believed to be nearly as widespread as pitchers using sticky substances — and it’s impossible, at this point, to say it does anything beneficial. But it does raise an important point for a sport fresh off the biggest cheating scandal in decades in the Houston Astros illegal trash-can banging. Everyone, it seems, is doing something to get ahead. And that’s another big part of the reason why legalizing pine tar for pitchers isn’t so cut and dry.

There are many teams, at least a half-dozen confirmed by The Athletic, who have their own special sticky concoctions. They believe it gives them an edge over other clubs. Why would they want to nullify that if the league comes out with a sticky baseball for everyone to use? Would those clubs, and their pitchers, continue to look for a sticky edge even if baseball approves a universal grip substance? What’s the incentive for a club that’s got a tried-and-true system to increase spin rate to vote in favor of a tacky baseball that might change the league’s power environment?

Cracking down and enforcing the rule against sticky substances wouldn’t be simple, either. Attempts to prevent something so widespread might lead to another cheating scandal, scores of suspended pitchers, and an angry half of the player population heading into a new collective bargaining agreement. And, since some substances are as benign as sunscreen, it’s not clear that even the sort of tight and close inspection you might see at a mixed martial arts check-in — with umpires physically touching the pitcher all over their body between innings and pitching changes — would be effective. It certainly doesn’t seem like something baseball would welcome, from fans to players.

There are no easy solutions. MLB is going to continue to work on its baseball; pitchers and hitters are going to keep finding and using every edge. There are contracts to consider and player buy-in to get. The potential hoops to go through to change or alter the rule, one way or the other, are daunting.

Creating a better baseball or just legalizing pine tar might seem like easy solutions. Instead, it’s all one big, sticky mess.
