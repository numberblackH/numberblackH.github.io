The most diverse portfolio in major league pitching resides in Yu Darvish’s right arm. According to his personal catcher, he throws seven or eight different pitches, depending on the day. A few of them exist in multiple forms. Last June, for example, Darvish took to Twitter to unveil a hybrid between a two-seam fastball and a splitter, having drawn inspiration from the signature pitch of Japanese reliever Yasuaki Yamasaki. Darvish’s version is faster. He calls it “The Supreme.”

“It’s almost impossible to hit,” said Victor Caratini, who has caught Darvish since 2019. “It’s like a split at 92, 93 (mph), and it’s really tough to recognize.”

In Darvish, one of the defining acquisitions of their blockbuster winter, the Padres are inheriting both unpredictability and a pitcher with whom they have history. General manager A.J. Preller scouted and recruited Darvish for the Rangers. Manager Jayce Tingler and Darvish spent time together as members of that organization. San Diego’s newest catcher, Caratini, accompanied the right-hander in their recent trade from the Cubs.

Yet his gift for keeping everyone guessing is precisely why the Padres targeted Darvish. They do not intend to stifle his creativity, which can mean altering a grip within a start, adopting another pitcher’s grip or abruptly reintroducing an old pitch. Few players possess Darvish’s ability to manipulate a baseball. Experience has aided his pursuit of mastery. And, at 34, he appears to have gained full confidence in his singular style.

“I think he’s gotten comfortable in his own skin and knows what he needs to do,” Padres pitching coach Larry Rothschild said. “That’s a good place for any athlete to be. I think it took some time. He’s at the right age. It seems like his arm is healthy.

“He’s just got a really good feel for what works for him, and when you get in the way of that is when you see the downside to him.”

Rothschild and Darvish share a mutual connection in longtime Yankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, who is close with Darvish, but they did not know each other before last month’s trade. Rothschild, of course, has studied Darvish from afar. In a way, their philosophies may have aligned years ago.

Darvish arrived in the majors with the Rangers in 2012, when Rothschild was on the Yankees coaching staff. The pitcher touched 98 mph throughout his stateside debut. Yet he often leaned on a wide array of breaking pitches. He threw his four-seam fastball about a third of the time.

From a hard thrower, such an approach ran counter to prevailing wisdom. As Darvish settled into a big-league career that vacillated between success and inconsistency, some wondered if he would benefit from shedding a pitch or three.

Rothschild, meanwhile, oversaw the early adoption of a trend that has overtaken modern pitching. According to FanGraphs, the Yankees went from throwing 58.2 percent fastballs in 2011 to 49.9 percent in 2014. Three years later, with New York throwing the fewest fastballs in the majors, Rothschild explained an ongoing evolution to Sports Illustrated’s Tom Verducci.

“Fastballs get hit,” Rothschild told Verducci. “It’s amazing to me to see guys throwing in the upper 90s and they get hit. … That’s how good major-league hitters are. They have adjusted to velocity.”

Speaking by phone this week, Rothschild was prompted to reflect on an early criticism of Darvish. Did the transplant from Japan indeed have too many pitches in his arsenal?

“I think that was a popular opinion, but that doesn’t necessarily make it right,” Rothschild said.

“In New York, we were always told you have your staffs pitch backwards and all this stuff, and it wasn’t a conceptual thing. It was an individual thing, what worked for each guy, and it just so happened that that’s how it worked out. I think with (Darvish) … you realize that he’s got a pretty good feel for what he’s doing. Just because he throws hard doesn’t mean he has to throw fastballs.

“There’s a lot of people that throw hard in the game that aren’t that successful. It’s funny to say it, but he’s really got seven pitches and they’re quality pitches.”

Few catchers are as familiar with Darvish as the one joining him in San Diego. Since May 20, 2019, Caratini has caught almost every one of Darvish’s starts. Their partnership began a few days after Caratini returned from a trip to the injured list. Darvish, whose previous season had been wrecked by injuries, was still fighting his mechanics and struggling to find a consistent release point.

“Which is really important for him, especially with all his breaking pitches,” Caratini noted.

By July, Darvish appeared to be rediscovering a former version of himself. He tossed consecutive two-hit outings, issuing one walk between them. He logged a 2.76 ERA after the All-Star break. He struck out 118 batters in that span, walking only seven. He went from being booed by Cubs fans to earning their adoration. His engaging personality did not hurt.

Caratini, too, is an amiable man with useful talents. The Padres, Preller said recently, saw him as a potential fit long before they acquired him. Caratini switch-hits, excels at framing pitches and mirrors Darvish’s pre-game studiousness. When the Cubs opted to surrender both players, the Padres celebrated. So did their newest ace.

“When I talked to my agent, I told him to tell A.J. that Caratini would be a set with me,” Darvish said during a Zoom call following the trade. “So if I come, Caratini’s coming.”

“Victor in his own right does a lot of work and puts a lot of time into the pitch-calling and things like that,” Rothschild said. “I think, with or without Darvish, he’s a good guy to have in the mix.”

The Darvish-Caratini battery has been built on a constant stream of questions and humorous banter. Darvish, who throws as many as 11 pitch variations and embraces advanced data, requires an attentive catcher. Caratini has acquitted himself well on and off the field, where Darvish demonstrates a quick wit.

“He’s a goofy guy,” Caratini said. “He’s always trying to joke around and be happy, have a good time.”

There were occasions for laughter in 2020, even during a pandemic-compressed season. Darvish, back to full health and peak form, finished as the runner-up in National League Cy Young voting. He threw his four-seam fastball harder than ever but also less than ever. (He also increased the effectiveness of the pitch after studying Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander’s heaters.) He leaned on his bevy of “secondary” pitches and maintained a lofty strikeout rate, proving more confounding than ever. When he was feeling especially good, Caratini said, he did not hesitate to unleash The Supreme.

“I don’t care what he calls it,” Rothschild said. “If it’s effective, it’s fine with me.”

In his Zoom press conference, Darvish linked his Chicago revival to the Cubs’ encouragement to “do whatever I wanted to do, prepare however I wanted to prepare and just be myself.” On the day the trade became official, Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer spoke of the importance of comfort and health. In the span of 18 months, Darvish had gone from being booed to nearly winning a Cy Young to joining a team with World Series aspirations.

“To me, it’s a great example that I’ll use going forward about when a free agent comes in and struggles,” Hoyer said. “You have to kind of look to this as the gold standard of being able to turn things around.”

The Padres hope to avoid a similarly bumpy introduction. Caratini’s presence should help. So could the pitcher’s history with Tingler. Darvish projects to age gracefully. He will not have to learn how to pitch backward, since he has been doing it for years. The past two, in particular, have proven the value in fostering his creativity, not stifling it.

“He’s different, unique,” Rothschild said, “and in pitching that’s usually a good thing.”
