[Hoyer, Cubs agree to new 5-year contract](https://www.mlb.com/cubs/news/jed-hoyer-cubs-new-contract) &mdash; Jordan Bastian(Jordan Bastian covers the Cubs for MLB.com)가 쓴 칼럼의 부분입니다. 간단히 요약만 하겠습니다.

It signaled the end of one of the great eras in Cubs history, but also the beginning of a new phase for the franchise. Jed Hoyer, Epstein's long-time general manager, was officially promoted to his former boss' role and finalized a five-year extension (through 2025) with the club on Monday.

컵스의 역사의 가장 휼륭했던 시간이 끝나고 또한 프랜차이즈의 새로운 국면의 시작이기도 합니다. 엡스타인의 오랜시간 GM인 Jed Hoy는 공식적으로 그의 전 보스의 역할로 승진하였고 클럽과 새로운 5년의 연장 계약을 했습니다.
