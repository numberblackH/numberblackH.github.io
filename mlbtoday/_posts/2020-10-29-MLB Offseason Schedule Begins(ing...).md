The Winter Meetings are scheduled to take place in Dallas.  While no official word has been made, it is expected that the in-person Winter Meetings will be canceled, and some version of the event may take place online.

### The opening of the 2020-21 international signing period.
A new addition to the winter calendar, the international signing window was pushed back from its usual July 2 date due to the pandemic.  The 2020-21 signing period ends on December 15, 2021.  The 2021-22 int’l signing window also won’t begin on July 2, 2021, as that period has now been pushed to January 15, 2022-December 15, 2022.
 -- Jan 15

### Salary Arbitration Hearings
The deadline for teams and arbitration-eligible players to submit their salary figures to the league, if a deal hasn’t been reached by this date.  Teams and players who can’t reach an agreement will go to an arbitration hearing to determine the player’s 2021 salary.  With teams increasingly deploying the “file and trial” strategy of using the arb deadline as a strict date for working out contracts, any unsettled arbitration situations by this point are likely to advance to a hearing, though teams and players can agree to a contract at any point prior to the hearing actually taking place (most hearings are held in February).
