Miami on Wednesday announced it has exercised the club option for center fielder Starling Marte, who will make $12.5 million next year.

Marte’s original six-year, $31MM extension with the Pirates signed in 2014 contained club options for both 2020 and 2021, so with both options exercised, that contract will end up as an eight-year, $53MM pact.

The #Mariners have declined their option on Dee Strange-Gordon.

Six players from the 2020 roster became free agents on Wednesday: right-handed relievers Brad Boxberger and Nick Vincent, catcher Francisco Cervelli, outfielder Matt Joyce and infielders Sean Rodríguez and Logan Forsythe. Cervelli has already announced his retirement.

Additionally on Wednesday, the Marlins reinstated left-handers Brandon Leibrandt and Brian Moran and right-hander Drew Steckenrider from the 60-day injured list, and outrighted them to Triple-A Wichita. Steckenrider and Moran elected free agency.

SAN DIEGO -- Padres right-hander Mike Clevinger will undergo Tommy John surgery(the second of his career) on his right elbow and miss the 2021 season, delivering an early blow to an upstart team with serious hopes of contending next year.

The club made the announcement on Monday, simultaneously noting that Clevinger has agreed to a two-year, $11.5 million contract which buys out his two remaining arbitration seasons.
